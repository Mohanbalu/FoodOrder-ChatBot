## FoodOrder Chatbot

The FoodOrder Chatbot is an interactive chatbot that helps users find food recommendations based on their preferences and previous orders. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end, and Python for the backend logic. Users can chat with the bot, get food recommendations, and place orders with ease.

## Features
- **Food Recommendations**: The chatbot recommends food items based on user preferences or previous orders.
- **Order Placement**: Allows users to place food orders interactively.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: The bot uses a conversational interface to guide users through the ordering process.
- **Real-time Responses**: Immediate responses from the chatbot based on user input.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
 - HTML for page structure.
 - CSS for styling and creating an engaging user interface.
 - JavaScript for handling interactivity and communication between the front end and backend.

- **Backend**:
 - Python for processing user input and generating food recommendations.
 - Machine Learning (optional) for personalized food recommendations based on previous orders.

## Installation

### Frontend:
1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohanbalu/FoodOrderChatbot.git `

1.  **Setup the frontend:**
    -   Open the HTML files (e.g., `index.html`) in a browser to run the application. The bot interface will be accessible from there.

### Backend:

1.  **Install required libraries:**

    -   If using Python and machine learning models, install necessary libraries such as `Flask` or `Django` for backend, `scikit-learn` for machine learning 
        models, or any other dependencies.
    -   Run the following command to install the dependencies:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2.  **Run the Python backend**:
    -   Start the backend application by running:
    `python app.py`

3.  **Access the bot**:
    -   Once the backend is running, the chatbot will respond interactively in the browser.
